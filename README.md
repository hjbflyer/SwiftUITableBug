This small app demonstrates a SwiftUI Table bug.

The app displays a person table with a context menu. This context menu should open a new view, allowing to edit this person data.
Because persons could have more than one address, the new view should display the address data in a new Table. This fails.

See the working preview below.

Here is the screenshot of the running app. The table is not rendered.
